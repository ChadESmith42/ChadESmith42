## How are you now?

I'm currently working on some React applications. I've not given up on Angular, but it's time to learn some new things!

I am a Software Engineer / Instructor at [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io). I instruct new software engineers in full stack web development using the PERN stack. Previously, I was a Software Engineer II for [Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City](https://members.bluekc.com). There, I worked with Angular, Azure Cloud Services, and C# APIs.

In my spare time, I do various volunteer work. I work with [Coder Dojo](http://coderdojokc.com/) and [NgGirls](https://kcwomenintech.org/event/nggirls-all-day-programming-workshop/). I also mentor new developers in the KCMO area.
