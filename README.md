## How are you now?

I'm currently working on some Angular Projects and learning to implement Google Cloud Services tools.

I work with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City as a Software Engineer II. I work mostly in Angular and .NET Core. I work with Azure DevOps and Azure services.

In my spare time, I do various volunteer work. I work with [Coder Dojo](http://coderdojokc.com/) and [NgGirls](https://kcwomenintech.org/event/nggirls-all-day-programming-workshop/). I also mentor new developers in the KCMO area.
