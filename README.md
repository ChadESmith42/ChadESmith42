## Trying to write better code than yesterday

I'm a software engineer. I like to work in Angular, C#, or Typescript. I like arrow functions and JSDOC.

In my spare time, I do various volunteer work. I work with [Coder Dojo](http://coderdojokc.com/) and [NgGirls](https://kcwomenintech.org/event/nggirls-all-day-programming-workshop/). I also mentor new developers in the KCMO area.
